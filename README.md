# Facts-and-statements
A compilation of different facts and statements.

The basic idea of this repository is to gather a large number of logically correct statements,
considered true, and draw some conclusion from them.

Of course, for this to be easy to process we need a standard (or at least something close to it):
* Keywords are donoted by a ```$```. 
	Example: 
	```The $sky is $blue```
	```If it $rains then the $ground is $wet```

* Keep statements as simple as possible. To keep it short: write them as if you were the one 
who's going to process them. [Wikipedia article for some help](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_connective#Natural_language)
	Example:
	```If $x then $y```
	```$x if and only if $y```


(This is by no means set in stone. I am open to sugestions)

# Contributions

* Add a branch with a descriptive name. Example: ```add_facts_ghosts```
* Add your statement to the file ```T/thing.stm```. 
	Where ```thing``` is the main subject of your statement 
	and ```T/``` is the directory named after the first letter of the word.
	* If such a file does not exist create it. (all lowercase .stm extention)
